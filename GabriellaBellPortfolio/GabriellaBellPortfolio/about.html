<p>I am 24 years old. I have a husband who I have been with for 9 years. We have a 2 year old daughter. She is the greatest blessing to us both.
We love going to the mountains to go hiking, fishing, and exploring. I have a twin sister who is also my best friend. I am also very obsessed with the Oregon Coast, we go every year as a family.</p>

<p>In high school I took a web design class and learned HTML and CSS. That is where my love of Software Development began.</p>

<p>After high school I attended <i>Coding Dojo</i> a boot-camp for Software Development where I learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Python.
I realized that boot-camps didn't have the right affect on me, so I took a big leap and decided to attend <i>The College Of Western Idaho</i> to get my <i>Associates Degree in Software Development</i>.</p>
